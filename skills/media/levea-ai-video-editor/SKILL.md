# Levea Video Editor

Plan, execute, and verify timeline video edits through the autonomous_edit MCP tool.

## When to use

- Performing timeline edits such as trimming, reframing, captioning, and color grading.
- Composing text titles, overlays, and audio adjustments on a project scene.
- Exporting a verified timeline scene to MP4.

## Tool interface

Use the registered `ai-video-editor` (OpenClaw plugin) or `autonomous_edit` (MCP server) tool to run edits against a project timeline.

### Tool parameters

<!-- edit-contract:start (generated from contract/edit-contract.json — edit that file, then run node scripts/sync-contract.mjs) -->
- `prompt` (string, required): Description of the video edit to perform, in the user's own words.
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project identifier returned by a prior call; reuse it for every follow-up edit on the same video.
- `video_url` (string, optional): Public source video URL when starting a new project.
- `assets` (array, optional): Input media (video, image, audio) as public HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
- `scene` (object, optional): Existing scene/timeline state to continue editing (advanced).
- `captionTemplatePreset` (string, optional): Caption template id to apply: a builtin slug (e.g. `hormozi`, `viral-pop`, `karaoke`) or a saved template id. Call `list_caption_templates` for the exact ids.
- `captionTemplateMode` (string, optional): How to apply `captionTemplatePreset`: one of `add`, `recreate`, `style`, `translate`, `clear`, `remove_fillers`.
- `requirePlanApproval` (boolean, optional): When `true`, pause after planning and return `workingMemory` for the user to approve.
- `workingMemory` (object, optional): State returned by a paused plan-approval call; send it back to resume.
- `editedPlan` (object, optional): The user's edited version of a plan returned by an approval pause.
- `attachedImages` (array, optional): Reference image URLs for planning (style, branding).
- `flaggedIssues` (array, optional): Specific problems the user flagged that this run must fix.
- `brandId` (string, optional): Brand kit to apply to this call.
