# Vertical Short-Form Video Editor

Reframe horizontal 16:9 footage into 9:16 vertical short-form videos with subject tracking and captions.

## Setup

This skill calls the Levea (livecore.ai) editing service, which requires a Levea account and API key.

1. Sign up and generate an API key at https://livecore.ai/?openclaw=1&utm_source=clawhub&utm_medium=skill&utm_campaign=tiktok-reels-shorts-editor
2. Provide the key to the tool you use:
   - OpenClaw plugin `openclaw-ai-video-editor` (ClawHub): set `apiKey` in the plugin config.
   - MCP server `levea-mcp-server` (npm): set `LEVEA_API_KEY` in the MCP server config. `LEVEA_API_URL` is optional and defaults to `https://api.livecore.ai`.
3. Describe the edit you want in plain language; the tool returns a project ID and, after export, an MP4 URL.

## When to use

- Converting 16:9 landscape footage into a 9:16 vertical aspect ratio.
- Keeping the active speaker centered within the vertical frame across camera cuts.
- Trimming a long clip into a 15-to-60 second vertical short with captions.

## Tool interface

Use the registered `ai-video-editor` (OpenClaw plugin) or `autonomous_edit` (MCP server) tool to run edits against a project timeline.

### Tool parameters

<!-- edit-contract:start (generated from contract/edit-contract.json — edit that file, then run node scripts/sync-contract.mjs) -->
- `prompt` (string, required): Description of the video edit to perform, in the user's own words.
- `project_id` (string, optional): Project identifier returned by a prior call; reuse it for every follow-up edit on the same video.
- `video_url` (string, optional): Public source video URL when starting a new project.
- `assets` (array, optional): Input media (video, image, audio) as public HTTP/HTTPS URLs.
- `scene` (object, optional): Existing scene/timeline state to continue editing (advanced).
- `captionTemplatePreset` (string, optional): Caption template id to apply: a builtin slug (e.g. `hormozi`, `viral-pop`, `karaoke`) or a saved template id. Call `list_caption_templates` for the exact ids.
- `captionTemplateMode` (string, optional): How to apply `captionTemplatePreset`: one of `add`, `recreate`, `style`, `translate`, `clear`, `remove_fillers`.
- `requirePlanApproval` (boolean, optional): When `true`, pause after planning and return `workingMemory` for the user to approve.
